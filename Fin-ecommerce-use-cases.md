# Use Cases

### 1\. Product Discovery & Recommendations

* **Recommendations**  
  * This is core to each job below. When we identify that a customer is in the Product Discovery & Recommendation role we must progressively recommend items that bring the user closer to their ultimate desire.  
* **General Q\&A about the brand / store**, e.g. “What is this company?” or higher-level questions about what they sell, Shipping  
  * “When can this arrive in Dublin?”  
  * “Do you ship to Germany? What does it cost?”  
  * “Will I have to pay customs/duties?  
  * “Can I click & collect / pick up in the store?  
* **General product discovery via natural language**, e.g. “Can I get a jacket for cycling in Ireland in October?”  
* **Sophisticated catalog search over items in stock**, including size, weather, activity, etc.  
  * “What size should I get?”  
  * “I’m 178cm, 80kg, and usually wear a M in Nike. What size is best here?”  
  * “Will this RAM work with my laptop?”  
  * “Is this filter compatible with my coffee machine?”  
* **Guided shopping for amorphous needs**, e.g. “I need a new couch but don’t know what to look for.”  
* **Explaining product ranges for complex catalogs** (e.g. multiple jacket types for different conditions and activities).  
* **Questions about a specific product on a product page**, e.g. details, suitability, clarifications, availability.  
* **Comparisons between products or variants**, e.g. “difference between items,” “which jacket is right for X.”  
* **Out-of-stock, alternatives, and substitutions**   
  * “When will this be back in stock?”  
  * “Can you suggest something similar that *is* available?”  
  * “Is there another colour/size that’s close?”  
* **Product care, usage & warranty**  
  * “How do I wash this jacket?”  
  * “How do I assemble this desk?”  
  * “My device isn’t turning on — what should I check?”  
  * “What’s the warranty on this product and how do I claim it?”  
* **Promotions, discounts, and pricing clarity**  
  * “Do you have any discount codes right now?”  
  * “Why is the discount not applying?”  
  * “Does the sale include this?”  
  * “Can I use a student / staff discount with this promo?”  
* **Repeat purchases & reorders**  
  * “I want to reorder what I bought last month.”  
* **User context:** We should be able to retrieve a users previous shopping history to tailor the experience \- what they want, query parameters (eg; size)  
* **Site context:** Questions about a specific page \- product/catalogue/filtered list etc…

### 2\. Cart & checkout flows

* **Add to cart** (buy button, add-to-cart, carousels).  
* **Remove from cart** (unwanted items, accidental double add to cart).  
* **Replace in cart** (adjusting selection).  
* **Checkout links**, so the customer can click through into the checkout flow.  
* **Checkout & payment troubleshooting**  
  * “My card keeps getting declined, what do I do?”  
  * “Which payment methods do you support?”  
  * “Can I pay with Klarna / Afterpay / PayPal / bank transfer?”  
  * “I’m getting a 3D Secure error.”  
* **Cart Abandonment Intervention** trigger a message *in the moment* if a user shows exit intent  
  * "I see you're looking at the cycling jacket—did you know we have a 30-day trial period?"

### 3\. Post-purchase support (maybe procedures)

* **“Where is my order?” / order status queries.**  
* **Change or cancel an order** after purchase.  
  * “Update my delivery address or payment method for my subscription.”  
* **Initiate and handle returns**.  
* **Unhappy customer**  
  * “The taste of this food is off” or other complaints  
  * Handle appropriately for the business  
    * Some will be super pro-customer and do anything to get them happy \+ turn them in to a promoter  
    * Others will have far tighter policies  
* **Reviews**  
  * This may be super valuable  
  * Need to chat with customers to understand this

# Customer Voice

Ecommerce support teams are looking for automation but are skeptical that AI can:

* Match the nuance, quality, and brand tone of their human agents;  
* Handle system complexity – fragmented tech stacks, intricate internal processes, and high customer expectations.

Have a unique brand tone or voice

* Tell us how you want your agent to sound

Merchants judge tools by clear signals: **resolution rate, CX, reduction in agent load, and sales uplift**. Fin Evaluation Playbook instructs teams to lead with outcomes and measurable proof points. Merchants need visible ROI during trials.

“Usage data shows Fin customers *train, test and redeploy* in a non-linear loop; merchants expect to tune the assistant with their own samples and run batch/preview tests during onboarding and afterward. The Train/Test/Deploy model is how merchants gain trust. “

“SE playbooks recommend starting trials with a **small number of high-impact use cases** (e.g., product discovery, order/return workflows, inventory checks) to create visible proof points that are measurable and repeatable. This approach earns merchant buy-in. [Fin Evaluation Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10X1UnIVHNMJwsnkTN2UwiW3Ygyx53xOpfvnZVTpdyzc/edit?usp=drivesdk) **Implication:** prioritize “low friction → high impact” flows for initial defaults.”
